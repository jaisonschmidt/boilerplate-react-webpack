# Boilerplate - React with Webpack

This package is aimed to be a simple starter kit for React using Webpack as a module blunder. Don't use this in production projects, I recommend that you use this for studies and as an easy starting point.

I'm using this package for my studies and POCs like React-Query, Hooks, or when I need some fast way to start a project, without a lot of tools or dependencies.

## Commands

- **_npm run build_**: to generate a production build package with bundle analyzer feature.
- **_npm run dev_**: start a development mode with Jest-Axe to improve accessibility issues and using React 18
- **_npm test_**: allows you to run tests using JEST and React Testing Library
- **_npm run format_**: runs pretty-quick to improve code format
- **_npm run format:stagged_**: is the same as that format, but runs over stagged files
- **_npm run lint_**: used to verify code mistakes using the famous ESLint

## Cool stuffs

- **_React-Axe_**: is a cool plugin, when you run your project, you can watch console with some accessibility tips
- **_Webpack Bundle Analizer_**: when you run _npm run build_ a file called _bundle_sizes.html_ is generated inside dist folder
- **_TypeScript_**: you can use TypeScript/TSX files (I strongly recommend)
- **_CSS and SASS_**: you can use pure CSS or SCSS files

## Dependencies

- [NodeJS (LTS Version)](https://nodejs.org/)

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Run **_npm i_** or **_yarn install_**
