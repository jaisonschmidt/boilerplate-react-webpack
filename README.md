# Boilerplate - React with Webpack

This package is aimed to be a simple starter kit for React using Webpack as a module blunder. Don't use this in production projects, I recommend that you use this for studies and as an easily starting point.

I'm using this package for my studies and POCs like React-Query, Hooks or when I need some fast to start, without a lot of tools or dependencies.

## Dependencies

- [NodeJS (LTS Version)](https://nodejs.org/)

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Run **_npm i_** or **_yarn install_**

## This is a work in progress

At this time I'm working in this package.
